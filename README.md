# Hangman

###Rules
This is what you think it might be. It's a computer hangman game. To start the screen will display the gallows,
then it all you have to do is type in a letter. If the letter is wrong, the letter will be displayed on the side and part
of the figure will be drawn. If the letter is correct, the letter will be displayed where it is in the word. If you type in a letter you have already typed in, the application will notify you as such. It will not count against you.

If the entire figure is drawn you lose. The appliaction will notify you if you lost, display the word you were trying to guess and ask if you want to play again. If you win the application will congradulate you and ask you to play again.
